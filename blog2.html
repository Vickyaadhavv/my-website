                <p>Learning is an inbuilt process. The first thing we learn is immitaion,that we have as one of the cognitive charateristes. Every one has the love towards learning the things that we learn are not always correct
                    but we can learn to unlearn the mistakes of being educated self learing is the one of the important component on the basic of cognitive learning. We would have learnt alot through the inspriration 
                    and those inspiration shall be either fictional or non-fictional. For example a kalaivan of mahabharata who was the self learner might have been an inspiration for many people who has read adout him.
                    There is always on urge to learn when we self learn same as a kalaivan we could be inspirational or become a inspiration when we become a self learner.</p>
                    
                    <p>There are several theories given by philosophers or pshycologists about the process of learning. For example, psychologists like Piaget, sigmund freud, Gustuv Jung has given their ideas about learning.
                    Piaget's ideas about cognitive theory gives wide range of knowledge about learning. self learning could be like automatic machines that function on their own because they do not have any person to guide
                    and help with it. But the best fact about being a self learner could make us the pioneer of self creation and sculpting. we might need several chisel to sculpt us but self sculpting could also look beautiful.
                    than being guided by someone, we should learn to be our guide because there are situations were me might not be able to rely on someone and in that situations we will be able to manage and overcome critical situations
                    only when we start to become a self learner. </p>
