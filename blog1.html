                <p>Every plot has its own story,every blog has its own content.This blog is about the plot where i learn about the blogs.Every person has an inspiration,some are tangible and some are intangible.
                    Those inspiration made me a blogger.Knowedge is power,Words are bullet proof,Experssing the feelings are the way of experiencing. A knowedge that is shared is like placing powers in the hand of
                    powerless people.These are the reason why i begin a blogger.I have a craze in sharing what ever i learn and through these blogs.I could share my knowedge,My words and my feelings.There are people 
                    who are either introverts or extroverts.Extroverts have several ways to express there feelings where as the introverts could not.By any chance if an introvert wants to share their ideas they could 
                    express it,They can expres it in a blog.I, for myself is an extrovert but didn't have so much of time and friends to share my feeling and ideas.So i started to express my feelings and knowledge through 
                    blogs </p>
                <p>This is my blog.I have actually made several alterations in my blog after i created it. Basics like changing the content on the front page. It is almost like content writing and while doing this makes 
                    me learn new words to enhance my writing skills. People who express virtually are called vlogs and people who express it through words and scripts are called blogs. Some would feel hesitant to express
                     or share their identity so Blogs would be a perfect place to express anything. Creating blogs are not my only skill or hobby. I do create websites with several user interfaces. For examplee, i like 
                    bikes and so I created a website which shows the bike accessories. Love towards creation made me create other websites like e-commerce websites which is like a clothing website. Every creators gets an 
                    ignition at their first creation even it fails. Blog is the first ignition for my creations to explode. </p>
